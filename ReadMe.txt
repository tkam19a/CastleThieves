I feel as this game accomplished what I wanted it to do. You are a thief you have to break in, steal stuff, and get out.

A time I got stuck was coding the NPC at first I was so lost, but after looking at the handbook it helped a lot and I was able to make a competent NPC.

My first puzzle is breaking into the castle, you have to examine the rock wall and you realize it is broken and there is a way in.

My second puzzle is finding out where the the treasure is and how to get to it. To do the puzzle you have to talk to the NPC/toddler about the treasure and you get him some food and he tells you how to get to the treasure.

My third puzzle is finding the key to the treasure room, and it is under the rubble in east hallway.

Adding the exit paths at the top of the screen, allows the player to breeze through the map always knowing where to go.

Aaron Hirahara tested my game. He caught a lot of my grammatical mistakes.

His feedback helped me make the puzzles a little easier for other people, because they seemed to only make sense to me.

I tested Aaron Hiraharaâ€™s game.

I was able to give him so feedback about how his game was in good shape.

I am most proud of making the game in general. Even though it is just a simple game. The fact that I actually made a game I can play and enjoy gives me a great feeling inside.

Next time I would spend more time to make different types of puzzles and add more NPCs to interact with.
